Rust implementation of the Lua scripting language

This project aims at implementing a functional, if not optimal, version of the Lua runtime for the 5.3 revision.

So far, this is mainly an opportunity to learn about Rust, but the final hope is to be able to leverage this whole architecture to plug into existing Lua code bases and detect at runtime potential buggy behaviours, Ã  la ASAN or Valgrind.
